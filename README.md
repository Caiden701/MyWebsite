How to Make Your Own Website!
For Beginners
 
Description
There are several reasons to create your own website. Whether you want to learn more about web development, showcase your website to your friends, express your creativity, share information, or have all your content in one place. Creating your own website gives you all these opportunities and more! Making your own website from scratch can seem daunting and overwhelmingly complicated at first, however this instruction set aims to show you just how simple it can be and how anyone even if you have never programmed before can create a basic website from scratch in just a few simple steps. 

Materials
•	Access to a Windows Computer 
•	Internet connection 
•	GitHub account
•	Text editor (Notepad)

Instructions 

Step 1: Setup
Before we get into the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS let’s make sure we have everything set up. 
•	Make sure your computers on
•	Connect to the internet
•	Sign in or sign up for a GitHub account (optional if you want to publish your website later for free)

Step 2: Folder Setup 
Now that we have our initial setup ready let’s set up our folders to store our files and program in. 
•	Create a new folder on your computer where you can store your website files. It can be named something like “MyWebsite” or “MyEpicWebsite”

•	Open your text editor and create two new text files. New>Text Document

•	Create and rename the first text file to: index.html

•	Create and rename the second text file to: styles.css

Step 3: Writing HTML 
Copy and paste the code from index.html into the “index.html” text file and then save the file as .html 

Step 4: Writing CSS 
Copy and paste the code below into the styles.css into “styles.css” text file and then save the file as .css 

Step 5: Open Your Website locally
Now that all our files are set up and loaded with the correct HTML and CSS code, we can now click the Microsoft edge file to see our website locally, without being connected to the internet, on our computer. 
 
Congratulations you have successfully built your own website!!

Step 6: (Optional) Make it Public!!
While having your website locally on your computer can be beneficial to you as the user it might be beneficial for others to reach your website as well so you can share information about yourself with others. To do this you typically need to have your website hosted which companies such as Hostinger and GoDaddy typically provide for a monthly fee. However, to get around this fee we’re going to show you how you can do this for free using GitHub!

•	Go to GitHub and sign in or sign up and hit the “+” icon to open a new repository. 
•	Name the repository and add a description and make sure the repository is set to “public”.
•	In the repository navigate to quick setup and select “upload an existing” file.
•	Upload the HTML and CSS files (not the text files) and then select commit changes.
•	Next go to settings>Pages>branch and under branch change the selection from none to main and then select save. 
•	After this has been saved go to code>about>settings (icon) and under website check the box that says use your GitHub pages website and then select save changes
•	Lastly click on the link that appears in the about section to view your website.

Congratulations you have successfully made your website public!!!
